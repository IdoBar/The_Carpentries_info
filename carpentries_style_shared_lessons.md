# Carpentries style materials

Here are a collection of Carpentries style lessons. These are not part of the official carpentries curriculum, but are a good source of inspiration whenever you need them. Would be awesome if you could add examples! please contact me 

If you want your lessons to be part of the currilumn you can propose them to [The Carpentries Incubator](https://github.com/carpentries-incubator/proposals): The Incubator will serve as a single point of entry for lessons or ideas at any stage in the development process.

## R

- Git using Rstudio https://stijnvanhoey.github.io/git-Rstudio-course/ This is a short lesson to teach git from RStudio 
using The Carpentries style version 9.5.0. proposed by Stjin van Hoey, you can contact @orchid00 if you have questions.
- https://tibhannover.github.io/FAIR-R/ -- Fork of r-novice-inflammation that focusses on function docu, packaging & testing. 
Was used in https://tibhannover.github.io/2018-07-09-FAIR-Data-and-Software/
- https://uomresearchit.github.io/r-tidyverse-intro/ --a condensed version of the Software Carpentry intro to R lesson, 
with tidyverse and a bit of modeling thrown in.

 
## Python
 
- Python for Atmosphere and Ocean Scientists https://data-lessons.github.io/python-aos-lesson/ Using Data Carpentry template

## Shell
 
## Git

- Customised from git - https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests
- Code refinery git intro https://coderefinery.github.io/git-intro/ - Guacamole example
- Git - Github - Rstudio https://inbo.github.io/git-course/
- Steve Bond (Biologyguy)'s Git and Github with examples that make more sense IRL: https://biologyguy.github.io/git-novice/
Two hour edition targeted at IT pros based on this version: https://github.com/dlstrong/git-novice/tree/it-pro-forum. I teach 
this as a full day lesson, and use a cut-down version for SWC workshops: http://gcapes.github.io/git-course. Writing a paper 
as the narrative, covers branches, revert, reset, rebase, remotes, PRs.
- Modified version of git-novice that uses Git Desktop and uses editing a carpentry data file as example: 
https://caltechlibrary.github.io/git-desktop/
-  SWC https://uw-madison-datascience.github.io/git-novice-custom/ - Teaches branches and pull requests

## Docker / Singularity
 
- Reproducible computational environments using containers https://dme26.github.io/docker-introduction/
- https://neurohackweek.github.io/docker-for-scientists/



## HPC
 
- HPC Carpentry: https://hpc-carpentry.github.io/
Made up of 1/2 day lessons that can be combined together in different ways depending on the audience
  - hpc-shell: Intro to the shell for people using remote advanced computing systems
  - hpc-intro: intro to using HPC systems
- A one day workshop introducing parallel programming using MPI. https://rantahar.github.io/introduction-to-mpi/
